Title: Who?
Slug: about

I'm a data scientist with a background in physics and a few years of experience in consultancy and start ups. Currently based in Spain, I am interested in all things data and especially how it can transform businesses and generate value at all levels of an organisation. 

I decided to start this blog because I love to learn and I love to write. I read that one of the best ways to keep improving is to get out there and publish your work, so this seemed like the natural way to combine these two things.

I am a big fan of focusing on the _practical_ side of data science and how it can help businesses, which is something that not a lot of people actually talk about, especially when it comes to newbies. I will probably dedicate a lot of space to this topic. Otherwise I am particularly interested in improving the "computer science" side of my data science triangle, especially when it comes to deploying data solutions.
